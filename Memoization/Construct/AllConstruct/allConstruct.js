// Write a function `allConstruct(target, wordBank)` that accepts a target string and an array of strings.
// The function should return a 2D array containing all of the ways that the `target` can be constructed by 
// concatenating lelements of `wordBank` array. Each element of the 2D array should represent one combination that constructs 
// the target.

//You may reuse the elements of `wordBank` as many times as needed.
