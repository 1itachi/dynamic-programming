racecar can travel in three lanes and always start at lane 2. Each step has a blockade and step taken to avoid it costs one step (2->1 costs 1, also 1->3 costs 1)
caculate the lowest steps that can be taken to finish of the race.

console.log(racecar([2,1,2])) //1
console.log(racecar([2,1,3,2])) //2
//this is a test
